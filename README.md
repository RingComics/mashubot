# Marvin
A Discord Bot for SCP oriented guilds
## Installation
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If running on Windows, simply [create a bot](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/getting-started-long-version), put your bot client token in `/json/config.json`, and run `start.bat`. Linux users need to run `start.sh`.
## Usage
`!scp [SCP number]` will send an embed message with lots of SCP info, including Title, Object Class, Special Containment Procedures, and Description. It will also post an image and a Volgun reading where available. I will update the Volgun and Title jsons periodically, or you can update them yourself.

`!help` and `!info` are self explanitory. Please do not change the `!info` command unless you make drastic changes to the bot and want to link your version. 

I will eventually be adding an option to update SCP listings. More commands may come later if I get any good suggestions.
